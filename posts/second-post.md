## Development status
This blog is just starting devlopment. It is at the point where it is able to be hosted and display posts.

## Next goal
I'd like to be able to add posts from a web interface. I think I'll make a separate project to populate a database of posts. This app will have to be converted to retrieve posts from that database.

Advantages of this method are that I can add posts without rebuilding the app on vercel. Posts would be retrieved from a server sided api and sent to the client. I think momgodb is well suited for this. I only need a simple database and I could host it using mongodb Atlas.

### Future goals
1. Add an about me page
2. Add links to github and LinkedIn
3. Register and set up domain name.
